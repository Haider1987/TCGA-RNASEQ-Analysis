#Using a few lines of codes you can find the number and ID's of patients with clinical and transcriptomic data from the TCGA for any cancer cohort. Thank you. 
#The "finaloverlap.txt" file contains the RNAseq of patients with matched clinical data
#The "patients_rnaseqclinical_matched.txt" file contains the patients with both clinical and RNAseq data in CESC.
